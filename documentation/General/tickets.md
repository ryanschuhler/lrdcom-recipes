> How to effectively request Website and collateral design services using Liferay's JIRA system.

Follow these guidelines to ensure that your ticket will be completed both really fast and well:
 
## STEP 1: Initiation

New site requests should be approved by a Marketing lead based on completeness of requirements and appropriate justification.

- Alignment - content/messaging/design/function is consistent and aligns with similar pages, marketing collateral, and/or other marketing efforts
- Metrics - performance for similar pages indicates there's a strong justification
- Translations - communication with Global Marketing regions has been made to determine whether translations are needed and when they will be available
 

## STEP 2: Design request

If your project needs Design, please submit a  Design for Web Request ticket in the LRDESIGN Project

 

## STEP 3: Web request

Submit a ticket in the LRIS Project based on the following guidelines

- Requirements are described in non-technical terms including critical dates (i.e., go-live date/time).
- Refer to Web Request Catalog (LRIS Section) to check that all the necessary requirements have been covered.
- Content/copy should be final upon ticket creation and attached, or a link provided.
- If content/copy has not been finalized, clearly state in the description when it will be completed.
- Related assets must be attached directly to the LRIS ticket or linked to LRDESIGN ticket(s).
- If assets are not available at the time of ticket creation clearly state when they will be available, or link the LRDESIGN ticket(s).
- Create and link corresponding LRTR Project translation workflow  Content ticket, if applicable. 
 

## STEP 4: Analysis 

- Webteam will analyze the LRIS ticket and contact the requester for clarification or additional info by assigning the ticket back to the requester with a comment.
- Requester may provide clarification by commenting back on the ticket and re-assigning the ticket to the appropriate Webteam member, or contact Webteam directly with a response (at which point Webteam will assign the ticket back to themselves).
- Webteam will estimate the time to complete the request and schedule the ticket to be completed in a future sprint.
 

## STEP 5: Implementation

- Webteam will implement the requirements and assign the ticket to requester for Approval. 
- Requester should review the work, adding comments in JIRA if further changes are needed
- Once everything looks good, requester should Approve the ticket in JIRA
