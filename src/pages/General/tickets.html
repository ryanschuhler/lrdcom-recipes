<ul>
    <li>Alignment - content/messaging/design/function is consistent and aligns with similar pages, marketing collateral, and/or other marketing efforts</li>
    <li>Metrics - performance for similar pages indicates there&#39;s a strong justification</li>
    <li>Translations - communication with Global Marketing regions has been made to determine whether translations are needed and when they will be available</li>
</ul>
